                                        <p class="text-justify font-zoom-out"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Crossing has arguably become an important paradigm in human-computer interaction such as mouse input, stylus input, direct finger touch and remote display interaction. Yet its interactive potentials have not been fully explored. In this talk, I will present some of our recent crossing-based studies to show how to leverage the expressiveness of crossing for interface design. First I will introduce the use of crossing-based selection in virtual reality. I will also talk about applying the crossing paradigm to moving target selection. In addition, I will introduce distractor effects on crossing-based interaction. I will conclude my talk with future directions of crossing-based interaction.

                                        对于任何计算设备来说，交互系统 (比如触摸屏) 都是一个重要的组成部分。但是当我们日常生活中的“物体” (比如衣服，饰品，家具，甚至我们的身体) 在拥有计算和智能之后，那些方方正正的触摸屏似乎没有了用武之地。这是因为“智能物体“将会是以各种形态来呈现在我们的生活中，它们可以是平面或曲面的，它们甚至可以是柔软的。技术的创新已经让”智能物体”开始走进我们的生活，并有可能给我们带来无限的机遇。但是机遇和挑战大多时候是并存的。我会从三个角度给大家分析搭建”智能物体”交互系统存在的挑战: (1) 硬件传感器技术, (2) 软件交互界面设计, (3) 能耗。同时我也会向大家介绍一些实验室在这三个方向上的初步的研究成果。我会给大家展示一个专门为情景化交互 (contextual interactions) 研发的织物传感器。这项技术能够让桌布，沙发等物体识别到一些会经常触碰到的生活用品 (比如钥匙，手机之类)。我给大家展示的第二个研究是一个存在于食指指尖上的QWERTY键盘，我们通过键盘设计让用户能够用拇指在食指指尖上进行英文盲打。我给大家展示的第三个也是最后一个研究是一个为小型物体设计的能够自给自足供电的触摸板。我们利用太阳能电池来同时实现供电和手势输入的识别。通过这三个项目我给大家展示对于以上三个挑战的初步解决方法。如果有时间的话，我还会给大家展示一些实验室其他一些好玩新奇的研究项目。

                        本期探讨的主题是面向人类未来发展，如何重新思考人与计算机之间的关系。 作为一种方向性思考框架，“人机共协计算”认为未来的计算技术应致力于如何开发人的心智能力并帮助人探索其潜力，人机交互在未来研究中的定位也不仅仅作为输入输出的手段，而是成为人在能力发展过程中的途径或场景。为达成此目标，就要求相关研究不能简单继承当下信息工业的思考模型与评价方式，首先需要重新理解人在计算系统中的角色与能力结构，其次针对人的心智发展，思考怎样在交叉领域因素之上建立适应时代发展的计算机模型，通过人与计算机之间的协同交互与相互平衡，超越单人单机所能达到的上限，使二者能够不断促进提升至新的层次。

                                    product and service design will reshape the relationship of people, community
                                    and environment. As an increasingly powerful technology, AI also prompt the
                                    design researcher and practitioner to rethink the harmonious coexistence of
                                    technology, society and culture. Human-Centred Design and Human-computer
                                    symbiosis also become an important field and direction of HCI and design
                                    research. Empathy is crucial to a human-centred design process, and helps design
                                    thinker to place himself in user's position to gain insight of motivation,
                                    behaviors and experiences. Symbiosis explores the optimal and ideal role of
                                    human beings in human-machine systems, and construct the sustainable
                                    relationship to achieve mutualism. The application of AI in HCI and design
                                    field, leads the transformation of design processes and methods. Designers and
                                    researchers need to re-examine the ethical and emotional factors of future AI
                                    application scenarios with empathy perspective. In the future, AI will be a
                                    partner of designer, AI will work with designers to create a preferable future
                                    with new methods and tools that complement the brain-machine advantage. Based on
                                    Human-engaged Computing methodology, this presentation will explore the social
                                    needs and cultural experiences of future smart city and society, using
                                    speculative thinking, futuristic concepts and design fiction methods, to discuss
                                    how to design the preferable AI product and service for future scenarios, and
                                    achieve a harmonious goal of empathy with human, and symbiosis with nature.

                                    of awareness of artificial intelligence under different autonomous driving

                                    With the roadmap of intelligent and connected vehicles technology, the driver’s
                                    Eye on/off and Hand on/off are always the key judgement of the intelligent
                                    driving levels. How to balance the behaviors of “intelligent driving” and human
                                    drivers are the key issues to ensure that collaborative driving synergistically.
                                    At the end of the paper, we describes an example of HMI design on Collaborative

Human-Engaged Computing (HEC) is an emerging research paradigm that aims to jointly advance the capability and capacity of human and computing technology. In this talk, we discuss the opportunities and challenges in defining and shaping the engagement of artificial intelligence (AI) in the process of empowering human engagement.

                                    Information Retrieval, particularly the design and use of voice search systems
                                    has been drawing significant attention during recent years. In this talk, I will
                                    address challenges and opportunities in voice search systems with the focus on
                                    improving the system capabilities and guiding the search process. I will also
                                    talk about a couple of related projects and their research findings and
                                    implications for voice search system design. Earlier research indicates that
                                    users of information systems employed voice search much less frequently than
                                    keyboard search because they disliked the system mistakes and the fact that they
                                    were unable to modify the queries. We found that in keyboard search, query
                                    reformulation is facilitated by partial query modification, which is not
                                    supported by most of the current voice search systems. Users need to speak
                                    complete query in voice search even with minor changes. We examined partial
                                    query modification during voice search, and then compared a system with partial
                                    query modification feature to a baseline system through a Wizard of OZ user
                                    experiment. The theoretical framework of Human Engaged Computing can help
                                    improve the search process of voice search systems, in particular providing the
                                    guidance of the dialogue between users and voice search systems. At the end, I
                                    will introduce a new journal called “Journal of Human Engaged Computing” we have
                                    been planning to launch.
