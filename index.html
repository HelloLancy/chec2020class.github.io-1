                                        <p class="text-justify font-zoom-out"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Crossing has arguably become an important paradigm in human-computer interaction such as mouse input, stylus input, direct finger touch and remote display interaction. Yet its interactive potentials have not been fully explored. In this talk, I will present some of our recent crossing-based studies to show how to leverage the expressiveness of crossing for interface design. First I will introduce the use of crossing-based selection in virtual reality. I will also talk about applying the crossing paradigm to moving target selection. In addition, I will introduce distractor effects on crossing-based interaction. I will conclude my talk with future directions of crossing-based interaction.
